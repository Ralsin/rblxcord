# Rblxcord
Simple app to show what you're playing in [Roblox](https://roblox.com/) to [Discord](https://discord.com/).  
You can download it [here](https://github.com/Ralsin/rblxcord/releases/latest) or build yourself with the instructions below.
## How To Build
Install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then open the command line and type in:
```
npm install
npm install -g typescript
```
Also make sure `node-fetch` version is not higher than 2.6.7 otherwise it would break the app.  
In case it is, you can easily fix that by typing in the following command:
```
npm install node-fetch@2
```
### And you're ready to go!
Now you can type `npm run test` and `npm run build` to test the code and build the app respectively.
